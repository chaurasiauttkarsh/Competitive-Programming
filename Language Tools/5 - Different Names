In Little Flowers Public School, there are many students with same first names. You are given a task to find the students with same names. You will be given a string comprising of all the names of students and you have to tell the name and count of those students having same. If all the names are unique, print -1 instead.
Note: We don't have to mention names whose frequency is 1.
Input Format:
The only line of input will have a string ‘str’ with space separated first names of students.
Output Format:
Print the names of students along with their count if they are repeating. If no name is repeating, print -1
Constraints:
1 <= |str| <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 second

Solution:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#include<unordered_map>
#include<sstream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    unordered_map<string, int> m;
    
    // Taking the string input
    string str;
    getline(cin, str);
    
    // Dividing the string into individual words
    stringstream s(str);
    string word;
    
    // Loop for the main logic
    while(s >> word)
        m[word]++;
    
    // Iterating through the map
    unordered_map<string, int> :: iterator it;
    int flag = 1;
    for(it = m.begin(); it != m.end(); it++)
        if(it -> second > 1)
        {
            cout << it -> first << " " << it -> second << endl;
            flag = 0;
        }
    if(flag == 1)
        cout << -1;
}
