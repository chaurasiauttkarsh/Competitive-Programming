Solution:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#include<unordered_map>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    unordered_map<char, int> m;
    int len;
    cin >> len;
    string str;
    cin >> str;
    for(int i = 0; i < len; i++)
        m[str[i]]++;
    cout << m['a'] << " " << m['s'] << " " << m['p'];
	return 0;
}
